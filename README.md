# ZSU Subject at VŠB-TUO

This repository contains projects for the ZSU subject at VŠB - Technical University of Ostrava. My student login is KUB0677, and here you can find my work on two key tasks: "Exploration Analysis and Clustering Project Information" and "Data Classification Project Information".

## Projects Overview

### 1. Exploration Analysis and Clustering Project Information

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering on the Adult dataset, a well-known dataset for socio-economic studies. The goal is to uncover underlying patterns and socio-economic segments within the data, emphasizing the influence of education, working hours, and age on economic outcomes.

- **Main Tasks:** Perform EDA to understand the data distribution and characteristics, followed by clustering analysis to identify distinct socio-economic groups within the dataset.

### 2. Data Classification Project Information

The second project aims to apply classification techniques to predict specific outcomes based on various predictors. (Details on this project will be added as the project progresses.)

## Dataset used

The Adult dataset, used in both projects, is a collection of anonymized data from the 1994 Census database, featuring attributes like age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, and income. The dataset is particularly utilized for income prediction tasks, making it suitable for both exploratory analysis and machine learning applications.
